## 1. Purpose and Project Goal

Simply, the project tries to provide a service that tracks market pressence of scooter companies in they cities in which the operate. Besides providing a full map-overview of where scooters are located (and what company provided them), additonal statistics and analysis will be dynamically generated; all for the purpose of answering the question:

> What is X (scooter company) status in Y (city)?

This information will be useful to both private and public actors, essentially allowing traking of changes of the scooter market: at a local level all the way to the multi-national level.

Besides a GUI to detail a full breakdown of a city, the underlying API will have publically exposed endpoints, allowing others to build auxiliary services ontop of the exsiting project.

## 2. Tech Stack, motivations, and helpful resources

#### Core Technologies

The core underlying stack of the app is the MERN-stack (MongoDB, Express, React, NodeJS).

The project also utilises containerization via Docker, as well as deployment of container onto a Kubernetes cluster via GCP (GCP Kubernetes engine).


## 3. Structure and Architecture

#####Frontend
React

#####Serverside
NodeJS with Express acting as the API routing layer

#####DB
MongoDB deployed on GCP (as a container on the same Kubernetes cluster).

#####Auixillary Services (data mining jobs etc.)
Self-contained backend jobs written in NodeJS, deployed natively on the kluser via K-native (serverless functions basically).



## 4. Deployment

containers => kubernetes kluster
